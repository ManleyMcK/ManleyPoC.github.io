            <p>
                There are many aspects to take into account when considering the design of a digital environment.
                This can be a long process with much testing involved to ensure the most efficient design possible.
                However, there are a few things that should be prioritized when considering the main points of the environment.

        <section id="system-design">
            <h2>System Design</h2>
            <p>
                When systems and environments are designed, many decide to go off a user-centered design (UCD).
                This refers to centering the design of the system around how it could be the most useful for the user.
                Though this type of design does have its benefits, it may not always result in the best outcomes for the user.
                What is convenient is not always the most beneficial. This is why it is critical to base the design around
                problem-solving rather than UCD. However, this type of design can overlap with UCD, since part of problem-solving
                includes user-based problems and frustrations.
            </p>
            <p>
                A specific type of design that focuses on problem-solving rather than purely UCD is the “systems-thinking” design,
                and this is a style that should be prioritized in the creation of a digital environment. The basis of this design is
                to first understand the problem, then create a holistic view of it and the possible ways to improve the issue.
                Systems-thinking design prompts the designer or developer to look at the system as a whole rather than parts using
                three main concepts. These concepts are interconnectedness, causality, and wholeness.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interconnectedness:</strong> Emphasizes how elements and efforts are connected. Different parts of the system connect to each other to work together towards a common goal. In addition, it can refer to the fact that there are many types of stakeholders that are affected by the system, so the connection between these stakeholders and the system must be understood in order to strengthen any design decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Causality:</strong> The concept that one action leads to another, which can help determine the root causes of issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Wholeness:</strong> The consideration of the whole system rather than merely the parts of it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When combined, the three main concepts of systems-thinking encourage the development of a more cohesive unit to ensure the environment fits and works together rather than having many separate parts. This allows for a better flow of information to the user of the environment.
            </p>

        <section id="content">
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>
                For the content within the environment, it is wise to prioritize that which will meet the company goals, like tickets, subscriptions, or other purchases. Content that will guide users towards these goals should also be prioritized. However, this is not the only priority that should be held. Content should also have importance based on user needs. This can aid the goals of the company. The ideal way to organize this information is to use the concept of information architecture (IA).
            </p>
            <p>
                IA is the concept of organizing information based on user need and information flow to cater to both the needs of the user and the company. To complete this goal, a series of steps are followed. First, the goals of the user must be understood. This involves questioning what the user means to complete in the environment. It is critical to think of the different types of users that may interact with this environment to be able to accurately predict the goals of the user. Next, the objectives of the business must be acknowledged and organized. This will allow commonalities to be drawn between the user and business objectives. After objectives are decided, the analyzation of competitors takes place. This allows weaknesses or strengths within the competitors’ environments to be observed, giving options to exploit.
            </p>
            <p>
                After content is decided, it is also important to define it. This will allow for the content to be organized and ordered more efficiently. By defining content, it is easier to see what content connects to each other, which can then help with categorization and prioritization. This then translates to navigation and user flow. If properly organized, the information will allow the user to expertly navigate and flow through the environment to reach their goals, which may likely line up with the goals of the company. Furthermore, the organization of this information can be tested using wireframes and prototypes of the environment.

        <section id="user-experience">
            <h2>User Experience</h2>
            <p>
                User experience is a crucial aspect of environmental design that could cause users to step away from it if not properly handled. If user experience is not prioritized, the environment may be frustrating or confusing, ultimately leading to the loss of consumers and overall loss of revenue or use. When talking about the user experience, most tend to think about usability. This is a critical point to consider, and it can be tested using usability tests. This will help find the weak or confusing points within the environment. Using this method to improve the environment will help figure out ways to mitigate the weakness within it. These new implementations can be tested again and again to ensure the most efficient environment possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another aspect of the user experience that may not be the first to come to mind is the visual design of the environment. However, this is equally important to consider. One research study in the <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> journal explains how visual design can prompt an emotional response from people and even affect their reactions to some degree. The visual design is what leads the users’ eyes to the functionality of the environment by giving the correct visual cues. A chaotic design can contribute just as much to confusion and frustration as poor usability. This is why a few steps should be taken to ensure the visual design is clear and consistent. First, the aesthetics should remain consistent throughout the environment. This includes color scheme, text size and font, size, and orientation. In addition, this should be balanced with clear distinctions and visual cues to clear up uncertainty. This will draw attention to the important aspects of the environment.

        <section id="bias">
            <h2>Bias</h2>
            <p>
                When designing a digital environment, bias must be considered. Bias is a natural reaction that all humans have within them. This also means that people will design based upon their own biases, since they will assume people will believe or behave the same as them. Understanding bias can help avoid it and improve the user experience. This will lead to higher revenue or usage of the environment by making users less likely to leave said environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                When mitigating bias, there are a couple of strategies that can be used. Like the systems-thinking design process, taking a holistic approach to design can lower the chance of extreme bias within the design. By looking at the environment as a whole and considering all stakeholders and users, more perspectives may be taken into account. This can also be done by testing diverse groups during usability testing to get a broader perspective on the matter. Diverse groups will widen the range of opinions, which can sprout new ideas and provide an outline of what the majority of users might think.
